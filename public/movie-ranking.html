<h1>The Best Movies According to Onur</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Godfather</h3>
<p>The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.</p>
<h3>Lord of The Rings</h3>
<p>Really cool fantasy triology.</p>
<h3>The departed</h3>
<p>
    The theme of betrayal runs throughout Martin Scorsese's mafia films1 and is at the very centre of The Departed (2006), not only as betrayal of (crime) friendships but also as unfaithfulness to one's ethnic identity.</p>
